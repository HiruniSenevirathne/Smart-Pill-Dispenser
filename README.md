# Smart-Pill-Dispenser
A Smart Pill Dispenser is a device that helps you manage your medication in advance and dispense it at a pre-programmed period using a smartphone and an app. Furthermore, it allows direct communication between patients and caregivers by notifying the caregiver immediately whether the patient took the dose or misses the dose.
